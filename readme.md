# Sample Data Bases

Herein is a collection of sample data bases I have constructed to exercise a variety of different design methodologies.

Most of them come with sample views to organize data, and a few contain DML to actually create some sample information to use in practice queries.

Full documentation is available for each published data base, and is documented in the `readme.md` files within each directory.
