# flight
A sandbox for practicing SQL queries. It simulates a small airline servicing various routes between airports and assigning crew to the airplane for each flight. It comes with a variety of views to demonstrate how data is organized.

## Purpose
Provide an environment for SQL analysts/developers to experiment with queries using simulated data.

## Use
To set up and use the database, execute the `.sql` file in this directory on your **MS SQL Server** instance to create the database.

## Documentation
To learn more about the database, access the [full database documentation](https://dbdocs.io/link/flight), including table/column descriptions and [Entity Relationship Diagram](https://dbdocs.io/link/flight?view=relationships).

## Files
- `flight.sql` - Script to fully create the database schema (tables, relationships, views).
- `flight.dbml` - Configuration file to create documentation.
